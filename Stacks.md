## What is Stacks
A stack is an ordered data structure belonging to the Java Collection Framework. In this collection, the elements are added and removed from one end only. The end at which the elements are added and removed is called `“Top of the Stack”`.

As addition and deletion are done only at one end, the first element added to the stack happens to be the last element removed from the stack. Thus stack is called a LIFO (Last-in, First-out) data structure.
